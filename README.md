# HTML Converter

This Java program converts a text file into an HTML file.

## Description

The `Main` class in this project takes input from a text file and generates an HTML file with the same content. It adds basic styling to the HTML file and includes the filename as a heading.

## Usage

1. **Input File**: Provide the path or filename of the text file you want to convert when prompted.
2. **Output File**: The program generates an HTML file with the same name as the input file but with the `.html` extension.

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
- Eclipse IDE (or any Java IDE) for development.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.
3. Compile and run the `Main` class.
4. Follow the instructions to input the filename or path.

## Example

Suppose you have a text file named `example.txt` with the following content:

```
Hello, world!
This is a sample text file.
```

Running the program with `example.txt` as input will generate `example.html` containing the HTML representation of the text.
